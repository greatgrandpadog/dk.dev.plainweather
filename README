This Plain Weather web application provides simple weather and forecast information using the unofficial Google Weather API.

It makes use of Python (v2.7), web.py (v3.2), SqlAlchemy(v0.6.8), Mako (v0.3.6), Mootools (v1.4.0.1), and JSON.

The application was developed using Apache to serve the content via mod_wsgi.

It was designed to work with Firefox 7 and Chrome 15.

To initilize the database run this command (from the parent folder of the plainweather folder):
[... ...]$ python InitializeDatabase.py

The source code in main/lib/PlainWeatherUtils.py will need to be configured with an appropriate user/psw for MySQL access.
